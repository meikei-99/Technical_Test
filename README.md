# Display NFTs of a given address @ Technical Test

This project was built with Alchemy NFT API to query data on non-fungible tokens (NFT) on the Ethereum blockchain.
The data that was fetched included:
1. Name of the NFT address 
2. Description of the NFT address
3. Floor price of the NFT address
4. Total suppy of the NFT address
5. Discord channel (if available)
6. Token Id 
7. Attributes for each token Id (In this project, only the first two attributes being fetched will be displayed on the frontend)

### **Disclaimer**
1. Since not all metadata fields will be filled out by the NFT creator, hence, data such as description and discrod channel might not show up for certain addresses. 
2. Alchemy's NFT API returns a maximum of 100 results per response. Hence, there will only be 100 NFTs (starting from the first) being displayed on the frontend of this project.

This project is still in development mode and future improvement is needed. It might take some time to load the webpages.
Thank you.
